I recently decided that I want to create a new website in the form of a blog with possibly some static pages.

## Why?

During my usual nerdy day I sometimes discover things I want to share. This blog is supposed to be the place. I hope that I will use it...

Additionaly, I had a website for a while now but it used WordPress and as a computer scientist I hate it. It's so much more intuitive for me to write a post in a markdown file on my computer and run `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` to publish it than logging into a slow backend and writing there. It just fits my usual workflow better.

## What technologies do I use?

### GitHub Pages

I was sure about using a GIT repository to versionize the content from the beginning and using GitHub Pages is just the easiest and most intuitive solution which is based on a GIT repository.

### Jekyll

Jekyll is awesome as well. I can write my content in markdown :heart_eyes: and serve static compressed HTML and CSS files. (Take a look into the source repository if you want to know how I compress HTML files). I wouldn't consider myself a web developer but I believe to know that this is a good thing for loading times and comparability.

During my transition from a fully featured CMS to TODO I somehow thought I should keep using a CMS but a smaller and nicer one. A lot of googling led my to grav. A plaintext CMS which I think is awesome! I almost ended up using it but Jekyll on GitHub pages is just too great :wink:.

## Things I learned

### Google Fonts

It is really easy to integrate nice fonts on a website using Google Fonts and they even give you the code.

TODO add code snippet

### Generating color schemes and fitting fonts


## Conclusion

It was a nice project but I am glad that I am not a web developer. I just never get HTML and CSS to do what I want and need forever to build a working page. Probably I solved some problems in an ugly way or didn't do things the 'nice' way. I would love tipps and advice!
